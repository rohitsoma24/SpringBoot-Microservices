in Microservices,
1)we will keep application.properties in github/gitlab
2)And we create a config server using spring boot which will talk to
github to fetch props file

3) And lastly, our microservices will(config client) will talk to 
config server to take the props file

and to build this microservice we will pass VM argument(dev/prod) while running
Spring boot app

-------------------------------------------------------

Why we are keeping this application.props in external location(github)?
-> beacuse this props file will contain a data which keeps on changing like
db configs etc
and we dont want to build applicaion and deploy again and again


Points:
1)develop store app
2)names for appltion url
3)rest WS is Microservice bcz it satisfies one of the MS modles(smart end point)
